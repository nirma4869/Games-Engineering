# Project Name:
- **Last Departure**

## Project Controls:
- The game must be started in the "StartScene".
- The player is controlled using **WASD** keys. Firing bullets or the trident is done by **left-clicking** the mouse.
- The trident is retrieved by **holding down the right mouse button**.

## Special Achievements, Challenges, and Lessons Learned:
### What took the most time?
This was my first time creating all the sprites myself. While this was a challenge, it was also a lot of fun because I felt unrestricted. Additionally, the development of this game came with numerous challenges that needed to be solved. After each piece of code I wrote, bugs would appear, and I often didn’t know how to resolve them at first. Programming the individual enemies took a lot of time.

Creating smooth dragon animations was also very challenging and time-consuming. Below, I've linked a document that chronicles the progress, achievements, and challenges of the development process. I gained a lot of experience during the development of this project. The biggest lesson I learned, which wasn’t directly related to the project, was time management. Since I worked on this project alone, it was important for me to deliver a finished project on time. I was able to achieve this through good time management, which allowed me to complete the project throughout the semester without stressing at the end.

Moreover, I really enjoyed the rigging process because it showed me that you don't have to draw every movement yourself, which simplifies many things. Programming the different attack patterns of the various enemies was also instructive. Implementing the Dijkstra algorithm was particularly interesting because I usually tend to avoid such tasks.

## Assets, Code Snippets, and Inspirations Used:
The Dijkstra algorithm was implemented with the help of two YouTube videos, which are linked in the documentation below ("Progress made until 18.04.2024"). 
The health bar above the enemies was also created using a tutorial, which is linked in the documentation below ("Progress made until 06.06.2024").
